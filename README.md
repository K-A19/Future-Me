# Future Me: Bridging the Financial Empowerment Gap

**Future Me** is an interactive, gamified web experience designed to combat declining financial literacy rates. By visualizing the long-term consequences of daily choices through a reactive digital avatar, the application equips users with the agency to master their own futures.

### The Problem

Current educational frameworks are struggling to address a global crisis in **personal agency**. As digital transactions become more abstract, the fundamental understanding of how money, time, and skills interconnect is disappearing. This "literacy gap" creates a present-bias trap where long-term financial empowerment is compromised for short-term gratification.

### Our Solution

**Future Me** transforms abstract data into an emotional experience. Instead of cold spreadsheets, users interact with a **dynamic life-map** and a **reactive avatar** that physically manifests the "health" of their life choices.
