Future Me: Bridging the Financial Empowerment Gap

Future Me is an interactive, gamified web experience designed to introduce financial literacy in a way that feels approachable and engaging. By visualizing the long-term impact of everyday choices through a digital avatar, the application helps users better understand how small decisions around money can shape their future over time.

The Problem

Financial literacy is often introduced too late, after habits have already formed and money feels intimidating or abstract. As digital transactions become increasingly removed from physical money, it’s harder for young people to understand how saving, spending, and balance connect to real outcomes. This gap can lead to short-term decision-making without a clear sense of long-term impact.

Our Solution

Future Me turns financial decision-making into an interactive experience. Instead of charts or spreadsheets, users move through familiar environments and make scenario-based choices. A reactive avatar and changing stats help visualize how those choices affect different aspects of their life, encouraging reflection rather than rule-following.

Key Features

Stat-Based Feedback System: The game tracks three core areas that change based on player decisions:

Savings: A reflection of financial security.

Life Balance: Overall well-being and stability.

Money Skills: Understanding and confidence around financial decisions.

Reactive Avatar: A customizable avatar that visually responds to the player’s current stats, helping reinforce the impact of decisions in a more intuitive way.

Scenario-Based Gameplay: Players navigate environments such as Home, School, and the Grocery Store, where they face everyday situations involving financial trade-offs.

Reset & Replay: A reset option allows players to experiment with different decision patterns without permanent consequences.

Why Future Me

Rather than focusing on maximizing a single stat, Future Me emphasizes balance. The goal is to help users see that financial empowerment comes from understanding trade-offs and maintaining equilibrium over time, not from making “perfect” choices every time.
